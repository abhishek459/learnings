A stack is like a pile of plates. You can only add or remove plates from the top. This is why it's called "Last In, First Out" (LIFO)
- The last plate you put on is the first one you can take off.
- The element goes one direction for insertion and opposite direction for removal.

Stack Operations:
1) Push - Inserting an element into stack
2) Pop - Removing the last inserted element from the stack
3) Peek - Looking at a particular index of a stack
4) StackTop - Knowing the topmost value of a stack
5) isEmpty - Knowing whether the stack is empty
6) isFull - Knowing whether the stack is full

Stack Creation:
- Fixed size of array
- Top pointer to point to the top most element
