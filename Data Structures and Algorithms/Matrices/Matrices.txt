- Matrices are n*n arrays, that is they are square matrices. They are more like to have more number of '0' elements than a regular array.
- There are n^2 elements in a matrix

These are some types of matrices:
- Diagonal Matrix
- Lower Triangular Matrix
- Upper Triangular Matrix
- Symmetric Matrix
- Tridiagonal Matrix
- Band Matrix
- Toeplitz Matrix
- Sparse Matrix

Diagonal Matrix:
- Only diagonal elements are non-zero
- Number of non-zero elements equal to n.
- Number of zero elements are n^2 - n.
- Used in image processing, for efficient multiplication of diagonal matrix with each pixel, to adjust its saturation/brightness/etc.

Lower Triangular Matrix:
- Non-zero elements occupy the lower triangular area of the matrix, that is on and below the diagonal.
- Row (Vertical) index must be less than column (Horizontal) index for zero elements
- Row index must be greater than or equal to column index for non-zero elements
- Number of non-zero elements equal to n(n+1)/2 because its equal to (1 + 2 + 3 ... + n) 
- Number of zero elements equal to n^2 - n(n+1)/2
- Formula to access an element of this matrix stored in a linear array is if i >= j then M[i][j] = A[i * (i-1) / 2 + j]
    where i is the row number, j is the column number
    The i * (i-1) / 2 calculates the total number of elements in all the rows above row i (excluding row i itself).
    j simply points to the specific element within row i.
- Used in solving Systems of Linear Equations, Finite Element Analysis, Cholesky Decomposition, etc.

Upper Triangular Matrix:
- Upper half of the matrix including the diagonal contains non-zero elements.
- Row index must be greater than or equal to column index for zero elements.
- Number of non-zero elements is n(n-1)/2 and number of zero elements is n(n+1)/2
- Formula to access an element of this matrix stored in a linear array is if i <= j then M[i][j] = A[((i-1)n - (i-2)(i-1)/2) + (j - i)]

Symmetric Matrix:
- If M[i,j] = M[j,i] then it is a Symmetric matrix.
- To store a symmetric matrix efficiently, you just need to store the lower/upper triangular region using which you can figure out the other half.

Tridiagonal Matrix:
- Non-zero elements are present in the main diagonal, lower and upper diagonal.
- So main diagonal is when i-j=0, lower diagonal is when i-j=1 and upper diagonal is when i-j=-1
- So M[i,j] must be non-zero if |i-j| <= 1 and it must be zero if |i-j| > 1
- 3n-2 non-zero elements are there and n^2 - 3n-2 zero elements are there.
- To store this in a linear array, first we take lower diagonal elements then diagonal elements and then upper diagonal elements.
- To access the index we have 3 cases: if i - j = 1 then target index is i - 1, else if i - j = 0 then index is n - 1 + i - 1 else if i - j = -1 then 2n - 1 + i - 1

Square Band Matrix:
- There are more than 1 equal number of diagonals above and below the main diagonal.
