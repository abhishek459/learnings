- Matrices are n*n arrays, that is they are square matrices. They are more like to have more number of '0' elements than a regular array.
- There are n^2 elements in a matrix

These are some types of matrices:
- Diagonal Matrix
- Lower Triangular Matrix
- Upper Triangular Matrix
- Symmetric Matrix
- Tridiagonal Matrix
- Band Matrix
- Toeplitz Matrix
- Sparse Matrix

Diagonal Matrix:
- Only diagonal elements are non-zero
- Number of non-zero elements equal to n.
- Number of zero elements are n^2 - n.

Lower Triangular Matrix:
- Non-zero elements occupy the lower triangular area of the matrix, that is on and below the diagonal.
- Row (Vertical) index must be less than column (Horizontal) index for zero elements
- Row index must be greater than or equal to column index for non-zero elements
- Number of non-zero elements equal to n(n+1)/2 because its equal to (1 + 2 + 3 ... + n) 
- Number of zero elements equal to n^2 - n(n+1)/2
